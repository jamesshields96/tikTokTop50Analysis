The idea behind this project is to use two different scripts to pull the top 50 music charts data, as well as the top 50 trending tik tok data over the last month and compare the results.
This project is currently a work in progress and only the spotify script can currently get any data, I am currently working on getting the trending tik tok data.

I believe this data will show that upcoming tik tok trends directly effect the top 50 music charts since by just looking at the spotify charts i can already see that trend happening.
